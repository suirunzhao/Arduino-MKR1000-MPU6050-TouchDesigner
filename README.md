Gesture detection using Arduino MKR1000, MPU6050 and TouchDesigner

The following blog is about how I combined the Arduino and TouchDesigner using OSC to create the gesture detection system.

This repo covers the main code to build the system, if you want to have a look at the tutorial, you can check my website: https://suirunzhao.com/. 

The idea for this blog was based on Charlie Gerard’s awesome https://medium.com/@devdevcharlie/play-street-fighter-with-body-movements-using-arduino-and-tensorflow-js-6b0e4734e118. In Charlie’s example, she used machine learning to train in Tensorflow.js. I prefer to use node in TouchDesigner to trigger the action which makes it easier to analyze the simple data.

Material:
Arduino MKR1000(another model can work too)
MPU6050(Or other accelerometer/gyroscope)
Battery
Wires
Micro-USB Cable

I used a mini breadboard to put everything together, and also used Apple Watch band to make it wearable.
